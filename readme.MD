A six days week flexible calendar project. Imagine living in the world where there's only 6 days a week, 6 months a year.

### Why
This is rather an experiment about tricking/cheating our mind / norms unto more rewarding system. We've been working all 5/6 days a week
sometimes just for the sake of the weekend. The society are perceiving the value of work and quality as something measureable often by the week/day/month system.

Let's create a system where no one is in control of your time, and where you value your time.

### Enforcement
It's going to be hard to follow such system, without a proper enforcement. We need to be aware of the system, and the system need to be aware of you. I am gonna write a simple one for that.

### Difficulty / Reward System
Along with the 6 days structure, there will be another active component to propel our life into some kind of meaningfulness. For example, you can subscribe to the highest level of difficulty and may have better reward stored at all.

I am thinking about a simple credit system. It's not necessarily valuable. But maybe you can use this credit to value your rewards, like 
- free hours
- items
- and anything.

And sometimes, all we want to do in life is just sometime to work for. this credit can be useless at one point, i am thinking about more usage case.

### Todo / punishment system
punishment isn't necessary at all. time is something you value, punishment by means of taking something away from you, means nothing necessary.

### Flexible hours
It's a norm that people usually work like 8 hours a day, but what about the other 16. You can be at the highest at one point and passionately do more work than others, but no one is gonna be there to witness them all. And because a quality job is timeless, it's not something you can truly allocate to, but let say if we do; and if we happen to do it faster than expected, shouldn't there be a rewards depending on how fast you achieve it?

This system should tackle the procrastination. There can be an sort of AI to help you on managing your 'burnout' time. You can take leave.

### Hope system
When I think about hope, I think about something to look forward to, something to live for, something to beat this dead soul to work for it.

### Tweak and customization
- Highly customizable (not really sure yet)
- You can tweak the whole order based on what you currently need. Sometimes, you're just too burnout. Just let the AI knows.

### Subscription
- Others can follow your structure.
- You can create a project, at the beginning it can be flat structure. This is for the case where you want to work a project with other, using this system.
