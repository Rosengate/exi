A six days week flexible calendar project. Imagine living in the world where there's only 6 days a week, 6 months a year.

### Why
This is rather an experiment about tricking our mind / norms unto more rewarding system. We've been working all 5/6 days a week
sometimes just for the sake of the weekend. The society are perceiving the value of work and quality as something measureable often by the week/day/month system.

Let's create a system where no one is in control of your time.

### Enforcement
It's going to be hard to follow such system, without a proper enforcement. We might need some kind of app for this.
